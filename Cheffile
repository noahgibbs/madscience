# This file is a bit of a hack, an attempt to make the one-file mirage of
# app-server.json.erb work properly while not limiting you to purely
# off-the-shelf cookbooks.
#
# Cookbooks required by the deploy repo itself are specified here, usually
# with specific versions. That's to make sure that, say, the NGinX and MySQL
# cookbooks are well-tested with the code to make them work. But if you mess
# with app-server.json.erb to add more cookbooks, by default that should work
# too.
#
# However, "works by default" has some limits. If you include cookbooks in the
# run list, we'll try to load them from the site(s) below -- mostly the
# OpsCode community site -- by name, with no further information. If you want
# to load a non-standard site or cookbook, or load a cookbook from a git repo,
# or limit it to specific versions, you're going to need to edit this file as
# you normally would with a Cheffile or Berksfile.

# Note to Berkshelf users: this is for librarian-chef, which is basically the
# same thing as Berkshelf and works basically the same way. Yup, it's Bundler
# for Chef.

# Read in node files
require File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), "config", "madscience_config.rb")
nodes_json = get_json_by_vm

# Now, get the cookbooks from the run list
run_list = nodes_json.values.flat_map { |node| node["run_list"] }
run_list_cookbooks = run_list.map { |s| s.split("::", 2)[0] }.uniq

# These two are supplied by the deploy repo itself
run_list_cookbooks -= [ "basic_config", "rails_server" ]
# These are given by specific versions down below. If you remove
# those lines, you have to remove them here too!
run_list_cookbooks -= ["runit", "nginx", "mysql", "database", "rvm"]
